aws-mfa: Easily manage your AWS Security Credentials when using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
=================================================================================================

**aws-mfa** makes it easy to manage your AWS SDK Security Credentials when Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enforced on your AWS account. It automates the process of obtaining temporary credentials from the `AWS Security Token Service 
<http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html>`_ and updating your `AWS Credentials <https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx3D6U6WSFGOK2H/A-New-and-Standardized-Way-to-Manage-Credentials-in-the-AWS-SDKs>`_ file (located at ``~/.aws/credentials``). Traditional methods of managing MFA-based credentials requires users to write their own bespoke scripts/wrappers to fetch temporary credentials from STS and often times manually update their AWS credentials file.

The concept behind **aws-mfa** is that there are 2 types of credentials:

* ``long-term`` - Your typcial AWS access keys, consisting of an ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``

* ``short-term`` - A temporary set of credentials that are generated by AWS STS using your ``long-term`` credentials in combination with your MFA device serial number (either a hardware device serial number or virtual device ARN) and one time token code. Your short term credentials are the credentials that are actively utilized by the AWS SDK in use.


If you haven't yet enabled multi-factor authentication for AWS API access, check out the `AWS article <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_configure-api-require.html>`_ on doing so.


Installation:
-------------
Option 1
~~~~~~~~
.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install aws-mfa

Option 2
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

    1. Clone this repo
    2. $ python setup.py install


Credentials File Setup
----------------------

In a typical AWS credentials file (located at ``~/.aws/credentials``), credentials are stored in sections, denoted by a pair of brackets: ``[]``. The ``[default]`` section stores your default credentials. You can store multiple sets of credentials using different profile names. If no profile is specified, the ``[default]`` section is always used. 

Long term credential sections are identified by the convention ``[<profile_name>-long-term]``. Short term credentials are identified by the typical convention: ``[<profile_name>]``. The following illustrates how you would configure you credentials file using **aws-mfa** with your default credentials:

.. code-block:: ini

    [default-long-term]
    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_LONGTERM_KEY_ID
    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_LONGTERM_ACCESS_KEY


After running ``aws-mfa``, your credentials file would read:

.. code-block:: ini

    [defult-long-term]
    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_LONGTERM_KEY_ID
    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_LONGTERM_ACCESS_KEY


    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = <POPULATED_BY_AWS-MFA>
    aws_secret_access_key = <POPULATED_BY_AWS-MFA>
    aws_security_token = <POPULATED_BY_AWS-MFA>


Similarly, if you utilize a credentials profile named **development**, your credentials file would look like:

.. code-block:: ini

    [development-long-term]
    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_LONGTERM_KEY_ID
    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_LONGTERM_ACCESS_KEY



After running `aws-mfa`, your credentials file would read:

.. code-block:: ini

    [development-long-term]
    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_LONGTERM_KEY_ID
    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_LONGTERM_ACCESS_KEY

    [development] 
    aws_access_key_id = <POPULATED_BY_AWS-MFA>
    aws_secret_access_key = <POPULATED_BY_AWS-MFA>
    aws_security_token = <POPULATED_BY_AWS-MFA>


Usage
-----

::

    --device arn:aws:iam::123456788990:mfa/dudeman
                            The MFA Device ARN. This value can also be provided
                            via the environment variable 'MFA_DEVICE'.
    --duration DURATION     The duration, in seconds, indicating how long the
                            temporary credentials should be valid. The minimum is
                            900 seconds (15 minutes) and the maximum is 3600
                            seconds (1 hour). This value can also be provided via
                            the environment variable 'MFA_STS_DURATION'.
    --profile PROFILE       If using profiles, specify the name here. The default
                            profile name is 'default'
    --assume-role arn:aws:iam::123456788990:role/RoleName
                            The ARN of the AWS IAM Role you would like to assume,
                            if specified. This value can also be provided via the
                            environment variable 'MFA_ASSUME_ROLE'
    --role-session-name ROLE_SESSION_NAME
                            Friendly session name required when using --assume-
                            role

**Argument precedence**: Command line arguments take precedence over environment variables. 

Usage Example
-------------

Run **aws-mfa** *before* running any of your scripts that use any AWS SDK.


Using command line arguments:

.. code-block:: sh

    $> aws-mfa --duration 1800 --device arn:aws:iam::123456788990:mfa/dudeman
    INFO - Using profile: default
    INFO - Your credentials have expired, renewing.
    Enter AWS MFA code for device [arn:aws:iam::123456788990:mfa/dudeman] (renewing for 1800 seconds):123456
    INFO - Success! Your credentials will expire in 1800 seconds at: 2015-12-21 23:07:09+00:00


Using environment variables:

.. code-block:: sh

    export MFA_DEVICE=arn:aws:iam::123456788990:mfa/dudeman
    export MFA_STS_DURATION=1800
    $> aws-mfa
    INFO - Using profile: default
    INFO - Your credentials have expired, renewing.
    Enter AWS MFA code for device [arn:aws:iam::123456788990:mfa/dudeman] (renewing for 1800 seconds):123456
    INFO - Success! Your credentials will expire in 1800 seconds at: 2015-12-21 23:07:09+00:00


Output of running **aws-mfa** while credentials are still valid:

.. code-block:: sh

    $> aws-mfa --duration 1800 --device arn:aws:iam::123456788990:mfa/dudeman
    INFO - Using profile: default
    INFO - Your credentials are still valid for 1541.791134 seconds they will expire at 2015-12-21 23:07:09


With Profiles
-------------

.. code-block:: sh

    $> aws-mfa --duration 1800 --device arn:aws:iam::123456788990:mfa/dudeman --profile development
    INFO - Using profile: development
    Enter AWS MFA code for device [arn:aws:iam::123456788990:mfa/dudeman] (renewing for 1800 seconds):666666
    INFO - Success! Your credentials will expire in 1800 seconds at: 2015-12-21 23:09:04+00:00
